Description: The intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is a critical
    parameter in cluster-randomized trials and is used to estimate average
    within-clusters correlation. A new resampling based approach has been
    developed for categorical nominal or ordinal response data with more
    than two categories. The method of moments (MoM) method, originally
    developed to characterize population genetic structure, has also been
    translated to the context of cluster randomized trials.
